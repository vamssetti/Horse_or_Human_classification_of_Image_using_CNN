# Horse_or_Human_classification_of_Image_using_CNN
 Classification of  human or horse data using Deep Neural Network. We will use a simple CNN model for the classification. Convolutional Neural Network extracts image features accurately.

 
### **Convolutional Neural Network**
- In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.
- Building Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using Tensorflow and Keras API.
- Since it is a two class Classification problem i.e a Binary Classfication problem, I will use sigmoid activation so that the output of my network will be a single scalar between 0 and 1, encodig the probability of the images.
